# Simultaneous Simulation

Maybe you’re about to take a real flight soon. In preparation, make sure to fly back to where you’re leaving from. (You will need to plan this, especially if you’re far away.) Then, as your real flight leaves, take off to your simulated destination at the same time. See how accurate the simulation is or isn’t. Enjoy the destination’s pin in a new way when you arrive, and let its vibe mix with the sensations of your real experience of that place.
