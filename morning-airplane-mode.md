# Morning Airplane Mode

Take a flight at night you know will last most of your sleep. Ideally, youâ€™ll still be on the flight when you wake up for a while. This gives you time to consider how to approach your day peaceful in solitude. (This recipe is also sometimes called "Red Eye".)

*The name of this recipe takes its name from one of Max Fowler and Catherine Schmidt's practices, as described in their [Disconnection Practices](zzz-library/disconnection-practices.pdf) zine.*
